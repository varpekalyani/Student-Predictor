## 🧠 Project Workflow
1. User inputs academic details (e.g., study hours, attendance, past scores).  
2. Data is sent to the trained ML model for prediction.  
3. Flask processes the model’s output and displays it on the result page.  
4. Optionally, users can generate a PDF report of the prediction.
